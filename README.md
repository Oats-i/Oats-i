Oats~i is an open and extensible web framework that allows you to create web apps using simple technologies.

## Documentation

https://oats-i.github.io/Oats-i-Docs/

Note: 
The documentation above should help you get started as I build the official site for Oats~i where we'll have everything for the framework in one place. In the meantime, you can already start building and testing using the framework through the series of tutorials I'm releasing over at dev.to (https://dev.to/oatsi) and YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@Oatsi). More content/tutorials are being added.

Once the official site drops, I'll update that here.
